## OPA Game CLI
This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Rust that allows the user to play the OPA Game. When the tool is run, it displays a welcome message asking the user if they would like to play the game. The user can choose to play or exit the game.

# Installation
To use this tool, you need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download and install it from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

# Usage

To run the OPA Game CLI tool, use the following command:

```sh

```

This will compile and run the tool. You should see a welcome message with two options:

```markdown
Hello! Would you like to play the OPA Game?
1. Yes, Please!
2. No thanks, bye!
```

You can choose one of the options by typing the corresponding number and pressing Enter. If you choose option 1, the tool will display a message indicating that the game is starting. If you choose option 2, the tool will display a message indicating that you have exited the game.
